**HEY THERE!**
This is my repository of the second evaluation, where I will show you my abilities with MySQL.

You will find some exercises I have completed using the ´Sakila´ Database, which contains data of a movie rental shop, including the info of each movie and the actors and actresses that appear on each of them.

Open the SQL file and discover with me different insights from this Database!

These exercises are the final evaluation from the second module of Adalab.
*Thought and coded by Raquel Castellanos.*
