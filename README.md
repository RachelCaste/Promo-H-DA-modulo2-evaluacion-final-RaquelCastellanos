**HEY THERE!**
This is my repository of the second evaluation, where I will show you my abilities with MySQL.

You will find some exercises I have made with a database called ´Sakila´, which is the data of a movie rental shop, including the info of each movie and the actors that appear on each of them.

Open the SQL file and discover with me different insights from the Database!

These exercises are the final evaluation from the second module of Adalab.
*Thought and coded by Raquel Castellanos.*
